## District Summary Analysis
After we did the district analysis, we find out that the standardized test score for grade 9 in Thomas High School were not correct, that's why we had to replace the standardized test score both for math and reading for Thomas High School by "NaN" which is stands for "Not a Number". So after our replacement we noticed that our analysis' result did not change significantly .
The district summary below is including Thomas High School grade 9th test scores:
